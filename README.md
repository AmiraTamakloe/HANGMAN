# PythonGame

This is our first game and challenge with my friends Jacob and Nour. We had two hours to create the game and we had the right to check one video but our result needed to be different from the tutorial. 
I (Amira) chose to use PyGame to do the game because of the allure and final result which resembles a real game.
